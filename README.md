# Greetings ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls

My name is Nakarri Pilgram, and recently i have been gaming alot so if anything you can consider that my favorite activity as of lately.
Now prepare yourselves *to witness the reasons as to why I enjoy gaming*

* The variety of game I have can cover what I want to do for the day. if i want a calm relaxing playthrough, i'll bootup a rpg. If i want a fufilling challenge I'll boot up a rythm or action game
* The games that I chosen are visually pleasing to the eyes with a great sound track to accompany them. It's even customizable to the point where i could turn down any volume i want so i can listen to my own music or videos in the background
* I can even gift some of the games i have to my friends so i won't have to experience them alone if i want, which creates a great outlet for communication on my downtime while having fun
